<h3 align="center">Basic Mathematics Game build with React Hooks & Context API - <a href="https://deep-math.surge.sh">Math Game (using hooks) demo</a></h3>

### Info
I learned different react hooks eg: `useState()`, `useEffect()`, `useReducer()` etc.
and build this project to implement those concepts & develop something practical.
- `Context API` is also used with lots of custom hooks.
